# CVD_Prevalence
The project uses Multivariate Linear Regression to predict the prevalence of cardiovascular disease based on a country's natural and social environmental factors. 
## Descrition
The aim of this project is to see if we can predict cardiovascular disease prevalence by a country's natural and social environmental factors. While the biological mechanisms behind why factors such as crime in an area influence cardiovascular disease risks are a bit unclear, several studies have shown evidence for a link [1,2]. For instance, a study by Penn Medicine has shown that in neighborhoods where violent crime fell the most, cardiovascular disease mortality fell greatly as well [2]. Since cardiovascular disease has historically been quite prevalent in mine and my peer's families, I sought out publically available data on a country's economic, environmental, and geographic locations to attempt to predict cardiovascular diease prevalence in that country.
